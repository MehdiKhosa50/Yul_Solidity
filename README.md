🚀 Solidity Yul Examples

Dive deep into Ethereum's low-level programming with practical Yul examples! 🔍

</div>
🌟 What's Inside?
This repository is your gateway to mastering Yul, Ethereum's powerful intermediate language. Whether you're optimizing gas costs or exploring the depths of EVM, these examples will guide your journey through low-level Ethereum programming.
solidityCopyassembly {
    // Your journey to EVM mastery begins here! 
    let mastery := add(knowledge, practice)
}
📚 Contract Collection
1. 📦 Data Types Explorer (YulDataTypes.sol)
Master the art of working with various data types in Yul:
solidityCopyassembly {
    let value := 0x42
    let addr := 0x1234...
    mstore(0x40, value)
}

🔢 Numbers & Addresses
📝 Strings & Bytes
🔄 Type Conversions

2. ⚙️ Operations Master (YulOperations.sol)
Unlock the power of low-level operations:
solidityCopyassembly {
    let sum := add(x, y)
    if lt(x, y) { ... }
}

➕ Mathematical Operations
🔍 Comparisons & Logic
🔄 Control Flow Patterns

3. 💾 Storage Wizard (Storage.sol)
Navigate the EVM storage like a pro:
solidityCopyassembly {
    sstore(slot, value)
    let data := sload(slot)
}

📥 Direct Storage Access
🎯 Slot Management
🔁 Data Retrieval

4. 🔧 Bit Manipulation (Storage_BitManipulation.sol)
Become a master of bits and bytes:
solidityCopyassembly {
    let shifted := shl(5, value)
    let masked := and(value, mask)
}

🎭 Bit Masking
⬅️ Shifting Operations
📦 Packed Storage

5. 📊 Complex Storage (Storage_MappingAndArray.sol)
Handle complex data structures with ease:
solidityCopyassembly {
    // Array length
    let length := sload(array.slot)
    // Map location
    let slot := keccak256(key, map.slot)
}

📝 Array Handling
🗺️ Mapping Patterns
🔗 Nested Structures

6. 🧠 Memory Layout (Layout_InMemory.sol)
Master memory management:
solidityCopyassembly {
    let ptr := mload(0x40)
    mstore(ptr, value)
}

📍 Memory Pointers
📏 Dynamic Allocation
🔄 Data Layout
